# How to use

1. Download all receipts as PDFs using the Coop app in the Scan & Pay section (this is the most annoying part)

2. Fire up the web service using Docker: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up`

3. Visit http://localhost:8000 in your favorite web browser, and import your PDFs

4. Look at the numbers and feel shame.
